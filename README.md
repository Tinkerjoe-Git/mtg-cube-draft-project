# mtg-cube-draft-project
Project name: MTG Cube draft. 

description: A simple command-line-interface drafting program utilizing Magic The Gathering API.
  Players can request card information with 'lookup card' including colors, cmc, type, text and more. 
  Players then can generate a 'cube' to draft from, and take turns 1 by 1 taking a card out of a sample hand of 15 cards until they've completed the draft
  Be sure to shuffle the deck before generating a cube!
  
  
installation: be sure to run 'bundle install' prior to running the bin/run.
